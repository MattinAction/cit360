For this course that isn't named Object Oriented Programming II this is where I will
place my working files. Once my team and I have completed the documentation portion
of the course, it will be added in as a folder with the documentation inside.

As for the sandbox code, it will be added in unique files and each technology will
have their own file.

Once I begin working on my personal project to claim fluency, it will be placed in
a folder indicating such. This also counts for the group project.
